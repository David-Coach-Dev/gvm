# GVM - Go Version Manager for Windows

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/David-Coach-Dev/gvm)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/David-Coach-Dev/gvm)
[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/David-Coach-Dev/gvm.svg)](https://github.com/David-Coach-Dev/gvm/releases)

GVM is a Go version manager for Windows, inspired by [NVM for Node.js](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [NVM-Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows). It allows you to install and switch between multiple versions of Go with ease on Windows systems.

> **Note:** For Linux/macOS, use the original [GVM](https://github.com/moovweb/gvm)

## üöÄ Installation

### One-line Installation (recommended)

**PowerShell (Windows):**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/David-Coach-Dev/gvm/main/install-nvm-style.ps1 | iex
```

**Command Prompt (Windows):**
```cmd
curl -o install-gvm.bat https://raw.githubusercontent.com/David-Coach-Dev/gvm/main/install-gvm.bat && install-gvm.bat
```

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/David-Coach-Dev/gvm/releases)
2. Extract and add to your PATH
3. Set `GVM_HOME` environment variable

## üìñ Usage

### Install and use Go versions

```bash
# Install the latest Go version
gvm install latest

# Install a specific Go version
gvm install 1.21.0
gvm install 1.20.5

# Use a specific Go version
gvm use 1.21.0

# List installed versions
gvm list

# List all available versions
gvm listall

# Uninstall a version
gvm uninstall 1.20.5
```

### Auto-switching with .go-version

Create a `.go-version` file in your project root:
```
1.21.0
```

GVM can automatically switch to this version when you enter the directory (if configured during installation).

## üéØ Features

- **Windows Only**: Optimized specifically for Windows (like NVM-Windows for Node.js)
- **Zero Dependencies**: No need to have Go pre-installed
- **NVM-inspired**: Familiar commands and workflow
- **Auto-switching**: Optional automatic version switching per project
- **Shell Integration**: Works with PowerShell and Command Prompt
- **Safe Installation**: Installs in user directory, no admin privileges required

## üìÇ Directory Structure

GVM installs Go versions in:
- **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\gvm\versions\`


| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `gvm install <version>` | Install a specific Go version |
| `gvm use <version>` | Switch to a specific Go version |
| `gvm list` | List installed Go versions |
| `gvm listall` | List all available Go versions |
| `gvm uninstall <version>` | Remove a Go version |
| `gvm version` | Show GVM version |
